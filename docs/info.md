## How it works

This chip perform machester encode or decode function that conver a paralle 8 bit of data to serial bit stream.
Here below is the pin function:
  INPUT:
    CLK100M   100MHz Clock is needed when DIR pin is 0. if DIR is 1, keep this input low.
    DIR       Control data conversion direction, 1: Encode (TX) / 0: Decode (RX)
    HALT      Control Halt or normal, 1: STOP Paralle/Serial Conversion / 0: Normal Function, do auto convert repeatly
    BIST      1: Enter BIST Mode / 0: Normal Mode
    RXD       if DIR is 0, this should connect the counter part chip. Keep low if DIR is 1.

  OUTPUT:
    DBGO      Internal Debug Singal Output
    TXD       Valid when DIR is 1, Keep floating if DIR is 0.
  
## How to test

  During BIST Mode, all bi-directional IO pin will become input.
  DBGO[0] will refect the compare error if TX to Rx loopback doesn't match.

## External hardware
  This chip require two clock
  25MHz
  100MHz

  8 Bi-directional pins might be input or output mode depends on the DIR pin setting.
